        <div class="section-header">Overview</div>
        <div class="section-text">
            The potential for harnessing the thermal power of volcanos has long been recognized, as these powerful natural resources can provide sustainable and reliable energy to communities in need. This can be achieved by extracting geothermal energy, which is the heat that emanates from the Earth's crust. This energy can be converted into electricity and other useful forms of energy, thereby reducing the need for fossil fuels and minimizing the associated environmental impacts.

        <div class="section-header">Benefits</div>
        <div class="subsection-header">Environmentally Friendly</div>
        <div class="section-text">
            Harnessing volcanic energy offers a greener alternative to fossil fuels, as it emits far fewer greenhouse gases and is more sustainable for the long term. Additionally, geothermal power plants can enhance local economies by providing job opportunities and boosting regional growth.
        </div>
        <div class="subsection-header">Economic Benefits</div>
        <div class="section-text">
            By leveraging volcanic thermal power, communities can benefit from lower energy costs and increased economic stability. This can be particularly advantageous for communities that rely on imported fossil fuels for their energy needs.
        </div>
        <div class="subsection-header">Sustainable Resource</div>
        <div class="section-text">
            Volcanic thermal power is a renewable resource that can be sustainably utilized, minimizing long-term environmental impacts. The release of greenhouse gases during geothermal power generation is negligible, and the Earth's geothermal reserves are believed to be vast and essentially inexhaustible.
